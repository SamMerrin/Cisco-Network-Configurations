# Cisco-Network-Configurations

With these configurations, my purpose was to show how to configure different protocols on Cisco devices. This repository contains some things I learned from my time studying for the CCNA exam. I go over NAT, ACL and Dynamic/Static Route configurations. These come in handy when working as a network technician, engineer or if you just want to practice in your home lab on Packet Tracer.
